#Design Principles

1. Code to contracts - not implementation
  * Interfaces
  * Abstract Classes
  * Classes with all public virtual members

2. Encapsulate what varies
3. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
4. Open Closed (OCP) - Component should be open for extension and closed for modification.
5. Favouring composition
